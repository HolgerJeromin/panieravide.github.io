YoHours
=======

Read-me
-------

YoHours is a web tool to create opening hours for the [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org) project,
in the famous [opening_hours](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours) syntax.
You can define when a point of interest is open in a week, and YoHours will give you the opening_hours value to set in OpenStreetMap.
This tool is written in JavaScript.

A live demo is available at [github.pavie.info/yohours](http://github.pavie.info/yohours/).
